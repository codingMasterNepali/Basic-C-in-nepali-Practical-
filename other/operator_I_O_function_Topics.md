1. Write a simple "hello world" C program.

####--Practice operators---####  
 1. Arithmetic operator 
         [ addition (+), subtration (-) , multiplication (*), division(/), modulus or remainder(%)]
2. Relational operators
        is equal to ->> [==]
        is not equal to ->>[!=]
        greater than ->> [>]
        less than  ->> [<]
        greater than equal to   ->> [>=]
        less than equal to  ->> [<=]

3. Assignment operator
        Assignment operator are used to assign value to a variable. The left side operand of hte assigning operator is a variable and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value.
        int a;  // variable declaration 
         a = 5; // variable initialization
         int b = 6; 
         Types of Assignment operators:
                = assign value to a variable
                += This is the combination of + and + operator
                -= This is the combination of - and = operator
                
4. Bit wise operator
        The bitwise operators are the operators used to perform the operations on the data at bit level. its consists of two digits either 0 or 1 .
        Types of it:
                &  bitwise AND operator
                |  bitwise OR operator
                ^  bitwise exclusive OR  operator
                ~   One's complement operator(unary operator)
                <<  left shift operator
                >>   right shift operator
5. Size of operator:
        The sizeof () operator is the most common operator in C. It is a compiler time unary oprator and used to compute the size of its operand. It returns the size of a variable. TI can be applied to any data type. such that float type, pointer type variables. It gives the size of a data type.
                        sizeof(int);
                        sizeof(char);
                        sizeof(float);
                        sizeof(double);
6. Input and Output Function:
        (a)Input Function:
                        scanf() 
                        getchar() 
                        gets()
        (b)Output Function:
                        printf()
                        putchar()
                        puts()
